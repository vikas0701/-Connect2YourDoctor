# -Connect2YourDoctor
PG-DAC final project
Introduction

• Document Purpose The purpose of our Project “Connect to Your Doctor” is to automate the process of getting medical treatment and health check-up in a way that saves both time and effort. It manages all the information of patient and doctors. The project is developed at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed to have access to everything. The purpose of this project is to create a web application that reduces the manual efforts of looking for a doctor and booking appointments.

• Project Background During pandemic Covid-19 was on high priority and almost all doctors were on duty at Covid-19care centre’s which lead to negligence towards other diseases. Many patients suffered amidst pandemic due to unavailability of doctor’s appointment. Lockdown restrictions made it more difficult to get information about available appointment slot and doctor’s availability. Conventional medical treatment and health check-up is proven to be not feasible in these pandemic like situations. There has to be some virtual medium which will provide ease to both patients and doctors.

• Goals of the project The main objective of this project is to build a website which will provide facilities to search for a doctor based on user’s requirement, doctor’s specialties and location. Patient can create or login into the account. Patient can check or book available appointment of particular doctor. Patient can then visit the clinic based on time allotted for appointment. The aim of our project is to bridge the gap between a patient and a doctor. This will save time and efforts of both the doctor and patient.
